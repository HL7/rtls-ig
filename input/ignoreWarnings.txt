# Examples are included in Bundle resource profile example.
The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

# Example CodeSystem is purposefully left experimental for now.

# A resource narrative would not be valuable here, as this is just an example using Location. Electing to not follow best practice recommendation.

# This is inherited from the core FHIR specification.
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 is deprecated with the note Use additionalBinding extension or element instead

# Proposing to move content for CodeSystem-rtlsMessageEvents into THO after the upcoming ballot -- see FHIR-41063. 
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/rtlsMessageEvents: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
