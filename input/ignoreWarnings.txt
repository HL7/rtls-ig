== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# instructions for ignoreWarnings.txt https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=66938614#ImplementationGuideParameters-ManagingWarningsandHints
# (And include comments like this justifying why)

# Examples are included in Bundle resource profile example.
The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

# Example CodeSystem is purposefully left experimental for now.
Reference to experimental CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/rtls/CodeSystem/rtlsMessageEvents|1.0.0-ballot2

# Resource narratives would not be valuable for these cases. Electing to not follow best practice recommendation.
Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

# This is inherited from the core FHIR specification.
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 is deprecated with the note Use additionalBinding extension or element instead

# Suppressing THO information for now-- will begin process of seeking an exemption from TSMG after ballot. 
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
