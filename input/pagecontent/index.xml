  <h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide defines the use of FHIR R5 resources to exchange information that describes the location of patients, providers, staff, equipment, 
    or other permanent assets within a hospital or other healthcare facility. This data is typically exchanged between a healthcare system (e.g. EHR software) 
    and a Real Time Location System (RTLS) that captures, processes, and stores information about the location of tracking tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    These tracking tags are associated with an assigned subject (i.e. patients, providers, assets) and their location data is recorded as the associated subject 
    moves throughout a healthcare facility. This location data has many applications in the healthcare context, such as workflow automation, staff/asset tracking, 
    and patient monitoring.
  </p>
  <a name="currentScope"> </a>
	<h3>Current Scope</h3>
	<p>
    The current scope of this implementation guide defines the communication model for sending location data for a tracking tag from a RTLS server to another 
    subscribed system, such as the Electronic Health Record (EHR) software, henceforth referred to as the subscriber. This specification addresses the tracking of 
    patients, providers, staff, equipment, or other permanent assets. Other subjects/resources that may exist in the healthcare setting such as supplies and 
    pharmaceuticals are not in scope for this implementation guide, but may be tracked by some systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    This initial implementation operates under the assumption that the RTLS server does not require information about the subject associated with a tracking tag, 
    known as the <i>Tag Centric Workflow</i>. In effect, this means that the RTLS system does not receive or store data about the patients, providers, staff, or 
    assets associated with tracking tags. Also, this means that the subscriber only receives location data for a specific tracking tag, and must handle the association 
    (and disassociation) of a tracking tag to its subject exclusively.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following relevant data exchange workflows are included as part of the initial scope:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Tracking Tag Activation</b> - Indicates to the RTLS that the subscriber is requesting to receive location updates for a specific tracking tag (i.e. the 
      tracking tag is associated with a subject that the subscriber wants to track).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tracking Tag Deactivation</b> - Indicates to the RTLS that the subscriber no longer wants to receive location updates for a specific tracking tag (i.e. the 
      tracking is no longer associated with a subject that the subscriber wants to track).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tracking Tag Location Update</b> - Notifies the subscriber that an activated tracking tag has a new/updated location, as determined by the RTLS.
    </li>
   </ul> 
  <a name="plannedScope"> </a>
  <h3>Planned Scope</h3>
  <p>
    Future versions of this implementation will support other relevant workflows for communication between a RTLS and another subscribed system (the subscriber). 
  </p>
   <p>
    This includes an additional communication model for a scenario where the RTLS requires information about the subjects associated with tracking tags (i.e. data 
    regarding the associations of tracking tags is stored in the RTLS server). This need arises when the association and disassociation of a tracking tag to its 
    subject is handled on the RTLS side, for any number of tracking tags. The following additional data exchange workflows are relevant for this scenario: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Tracking Tag Association</b> - Indicates that a specific tracking tag is newly associated with a subject and is now activated. This communication can originate 
      from either the RTLS or the subscriber.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tracking Tag Disassociation</b> - Indicates that a specific tracking tag is no longer associated with a subject and is no longer activated. This communication 
      can originate from either the RTLS or the subscriber.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Guidelines for implementing other data exchange workflows are planned to be added in the future to support additional functionality that some Real Time Location 
    Systems may offer, such as the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Tracking Tag Colocation Notification</b> - Indicates that two or more activated tracking tags, each associated with a unique subject, are in the same location 
      and are determined to be "co-located," as defined by the RTLS. Consider, for example, two tracking tags where one is associated to a patient and the other to a 
      provider. The two tracking tags are in the same location for more than 30 seconds while the provider is examining the patient. If 30 seconds is the length of time 
      at which the RTLS considers two subjects to be "co-located," the subscriber would be notified of the colocation event.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tracking Tag Auxiliary Function</b> - Notifies the subscriber that an auxiliary function supported by an activated tracking tag was performed (e.g. a button 
      located on the tracking tag was pressed by the subject).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tracking Tag Status Update</b> - Notifies the subscriber that an activated tracking tag has an update in status (e.g. the tracking tag has low remaining battery life).
    </li>
    <li>
    	<b>Tracking Tag Availability Update</b> - Indicates to the subscriber whether a currently deactivated tracking tag is or isn't available to be associated with a subject 
      (e.g. a tracking tag is lost/missing, non-functional, or newly added to circulation)
    </li>
  </ul>
