  <h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide defines the use of FHIR R4 resources to exchange Real Time Location Services (RTLS) information that indicates 
	where patients, staff, devices, or other assets are located within a hospital or other healthcare facility.
  </p>
  <p>
    RTLS systems use tags that are assigned to the subject being tracked and communicate their location in real time using a sensory network 
	within a facility. This location data is typically exchanged between a RTLS system and hospital EHR system and has many applications such 
	as workflow automation, staff/asset tracking, and patient monitoring.

	<h3>Scope</h3>
	<p>
    		The scope of this implementation guide includes support for workflows related to the implementation of a RTLS system. This includes the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Tag location updates
    </li>
    <li>
      Tag assignment and unassignment for patients, staff, or devices
    </li>
    <li>
      Tag colocation notifications
    </li>
    <li>
      Tag auxiliary functions (e.g. button presses)
    </li>
    <li>
      Tag health updates (e.g. battery state)
    </li>
    <li>
      Addition and removal of tags from circulation
    </li>
  </ul>
