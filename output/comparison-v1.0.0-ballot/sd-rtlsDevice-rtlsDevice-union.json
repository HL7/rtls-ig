When the device is not subject to including the UDI (e.g., its presence and exchange is not mandated by local regulatory requirements or specific use case at hand), thus the concept of production identifiers is not relevant as a set, it remains helpful for consistency to still use Device.serialNumber rather than using Device.identifier with an appropriate type.
