While a serial number is a type of identifier, in the context of devices for which a UDI is required, thus a serial number may be part of the production identifier, it is more informative to have the serial number as a dedicated attribute together with the other UDI production identifier.  When the device is not subject to including the UDI (e.g., its presence and exchange is not mandated by local regulatory requirements or specific use case at hand), thus the concept of production identifiers is not relevant as a set, it remains helpful for consistency to still use Device.serialNumber rather than using Device.identifier with an appropriate type.
